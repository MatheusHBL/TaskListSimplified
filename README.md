# Task List App

This is a simple task list application built with React and Vite. The application allows users to manage their tasks effectively by providing features to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks. Users can also categorize tasks, set priorities, and define deadlines as they improve their skills.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks using a form.
- **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be modified.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Categories, Priorities, and Deadlines**: Future enhancements will include options to categorize tasks, set priorities, and define deadlines.
